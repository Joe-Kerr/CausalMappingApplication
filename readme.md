# Welcome to the Causal Mapping Application

This project is based on a prior closed source, commercial application known as "Causal Cognitive Mapping Application". The latter version 1 has reached its end of life. The new version 2 is offered as **free to use**.

## Project status

The Causal Mapping Application (v2) is in development. But you can already use a test version by following the link above. Some of the major milestones are:

- large increase of the possible use cases
- replacement of a core code library
- remove "commercial" kind of code (e.g. licensing)
